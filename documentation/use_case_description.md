# CKD Diet and Lab Result Interpretation Chatbot - Use Case Description

## Project Overview
This project develops an AI-powered chatbot to help patients with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) understand their lab results and make informed dietary choices using evidence-based health education materials from Canadian health authorities.

## Problem Statement

### User Pain Points
1. **Lab Result Confusion**: Many CKD patients receive eGFR results but don't understand what the numbers mean or which stage of kidney disease they indicate
2. **Dietary Overwhelm**: Patients struggle to understand complex dietary restrictions around potassium, phosphorus, sodium, and protein
3. **Information Accessibility**: Reliable kidney health information is scattered across multiple websites and resources
4. **24/7 Support Gap**: Patients have questions outside of clinic hours but lack immediate access to reliable guidance
5. **Canadian Context**: Many resources are US-focused; patients need information relevant to Canadian healthcare and food availability

### Current Challenges
- Patients often rely on unreliable internet sources for health information
- Waitlists for dietitian appointments can be lengthy
- Complex medical terminology creates barriers to understanding
- Dietary guidelines can seem restrictive and overwhelming
- Lack of personalized, immediate educational support

## Target Users

### Primary Users
- **CKD Patients (Stages 1-4)**: Individuals diagnosed with chronic kidney disease seeking to understand their condition and manage their diet
- **Caregivers**: Family members supporting someone with CKD
- **Pre-dialysis Patients**: Those approaching Stage 5 who need intensive dietary management

### User Characteristics
- **Age Range**: Primarily 45-75 years old
- **Tech Comfort**: Varying levels of digital literacy
- **Health Status**: Managing CKD alongside other conditions (diabetes, hypertension)
- **Geographic**: Nova Scotia residents, but applicable across Canada
- **Information Needs**: Practical, actionable guidance in plain language

## Success Criteria

### Functional Success Metrics
1. **Accurate Information Delivery**: Chatbot provides correct eGFR staging information (e.g., eGFR 50 = Stage 3 CKD)
2. **Comprehensive Diet Guidance**: Successfully answers questions about high/low potassium foods, meal planning, and food substitutions
3. **Safety Compliance**: Always includes appropriate medical disclaimers and directs users to healthcare providers when necessary
4. **Source Reliability**: All information derived from trusted Canadian health authorities

### User Experience Success Metrics
1. **Clarity**: Users understand responses without needing medical background
2. **Supportiveness**: Responses feel encouraging rather than overwhelming
3. **Actionability**: Users can implement dietary suggestions immediately
4. **Safety**: Users understand when to seek professional medical care

### Educational Success Metrics
1. **Knowledge Transfer**: Users demonstrate improved understanding of their CKD stage and dietary needs
2. **Empowerment**: Users feel more confident managing their condition
3. **Resource Connection**: Users are appropriately directed to healthcare professionals and additional resources

## Use Case Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Lab Result Interpretation
**User Input**: "My eGFR came back as 50â€”what stage is that?"
**Expected Response**: Clear explanation of Stage 3 CKD, what it means for kidney function, and guidance to discuss with healthcare provider

### Scenario 2: Dietary Guidance
**User Input**: "Which fruits and vegetables should I avoid because of high potassium?"
**Expected Response**: Comprehensive list of high-potassium foods to limit, low-potassium alternatives, and practical meal planning tips

### Scenario 3: Disease Progression Concern
**User Input**: "I'm worried my kidney disease is getting worse. What should I look for?"
**Expected Response**: General information about CKD progression, symptom awareness, and strong encouragement to discuss concerns with nephrologist

### Scenario 4: Meal Planning Support
**User Input**: "Can you help me plan a kidney-friendly dinner?"
**Expected Response**: Practical meal suggestions considering sodium, potassium, phosphorus, and protein restrictions with recipe ideas

## Technical Requirements

### Knowledge Base Requirements
- 5-6 authoritative health education documents
- Canadian health authority sources prioritized
- Coverage of eGFR staging, dietary guidelines, and food lists
- Formatted for optimal RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) performance

### Chatbot Capabilities
- Natural language processing for health-related queries
- Document retrieval and synthesis
- Safety disclaimer integration
- Appropriate response scoping (educational, not diagnostic)

## Ethical Considerations

### Medical Disclaimer Requirements
- Clear statement that chatbot is educational, not diagnostic
- Consistent direction to healthcare professionals
- Emergency symptom recognition and appropriate escalation
- Acknowledgment of individual variation in medical needs

### Privacy and Safety
- No collection or storage of personal health information
- Clear boundaries around medical advice vs. education
- Cultural sensitivity in dietary recommendations
- Accessibility considerations for diverse user needs

## Project Scope Limitations

### What the Chatbot Will NOT Do
- Provide medical diagnoses or personalized medical advice
- Recommend specific medications or treatments
- Replace healthcare provider consultations
- Handle medical emergencies
- Store or analyze personal health data

### Out of Scope for This Project
- Integration with electronic health records
- Personalized meal planning based on individual lab values
- Medication interaction checking
- Real-time health monitoring
- Multi-language support (English only for initial version)

## Success Measurement Plan

### Immediate Testing
- Verification that required test questions are answered correctly
- Review of response quality and appropriateness
- Safety disclaimer presence and accuracy

### Future Evaluation Opportunities
- User satisfaction surveys
- Healthcare provider feedback
- Accuracy validation by renal dietitians
- Usage analytics and common question patterns

## Next Steps for Implementation
1. Deploy chatbot using Ollama + AnythingLLM stack
2. Load knowledge base documents
3. Configure system prompt and response parameters
4. Conduct testing with scenario questions
5. Document deployment and usage instructions
6. Create demonstration materials for project submission
